# NCI-DOE-Collab-Pilot1-Mutation_Classifier

### Description:
The Mutation Classifier capability (P1B2) shows how to build a deep learning network that can classify the cancer type.

### User Community:	
Researchers interested in sparse data classification; machine learning; deep learning.

### Usability:	
The provided untrained model can be used by a data scientist to be trained on their own data. The provided scripts use data that have been downloaded and normalized from GDC.

### Uniqueness:	
Exercise two core capabilities we need to build: (1) classification based on very sparse input data; (2) evaluation of the information content and predictive value in a molecular assay with auxiliary learning tasks.

### Components:	
* Processed training and test data
* Untrained neural network model
* Trained model weights and topology

### Technical Details:
Please refer to this [README](./Pilot1/P1B2/README.md)
